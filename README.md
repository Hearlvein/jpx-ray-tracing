# jpx-ray-tracing
Trying to build a hand made ray tracing system using SFML

Very simple project to simulate ray tracing.

Characteristics:
  - array of width * height element
  - each cell of the array is a square of px_sz size and represents a pixel (a cell represents px_sz^2 pixels)
  - movable spotlight (Z, Q, S, D)
  - movable opaque obstacle (arrow keys)
  - adaptable smooth level (P, M)
